## Latest Development Changes

Deployed: https://better-reads10.herokuapp.com

## Future Features
With this project we would like to expand our scope beyond the books current in the Database and add and populate more books to the Database

These are some of our purposed additions:
- Adding a review functionality where users can leave reviews for certain books, rating the books as well.
- Having an add friends function where readers can find different users who are interested in the same books and connect, piggy backing off this idea we can also have a chat functionality where users can communicate with friends and other users through    blogs or chat.
- Being able to pick certain books and populating a “more books like this” functionality then swinging over to the recommendation page with more books to choose from.
- Being able to specify in search bar for title, author, genre.
